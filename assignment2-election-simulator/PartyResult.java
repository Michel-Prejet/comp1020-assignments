 * 
 *          PURPOSE: Represents a political party with a name and a count (which
 *          could refer to the number of votes or seats, or the weight of the
 *          party). Provides getter methods for both these instance variables,
 *          and a method to increment the party's count by a given amount. Also
 *          provides static methods for a PartyResult ArrayList, which allow the
 *          user to get and increment the count of a specific party in the 
 *          ArrayList, and to get the two parties in the ArrayList with the 
 *          highest count. Helper methods are used to validate party names, get 
 *          the index of a party with a given name in an ArrayList, and get the 
 *          party with the highest count in an ArrayList.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
