 *          PURPOSE: Represents an electoral riding in a Canadian federal 
 *          election. Contains the name of the riding, its ID, the ProvinceTerritory
 *          in which it is located, the number of electors, and the list of 
 *          candidates. Provides getter methods for each of these instance 
 *          variables, and methods to add a Candidate, get the total number of 
 *          votes cast, get the voter turnout, and get the winning candidate 
 *          (using first-past-the-post).
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
