 * INSTRUCTOR Simon Wermie
 * ASSIGNMENT 2, 5
 * 
 * @author Michel Pr√©jet
 * @version July 24th, 2025
 * 
 *          PURPOSE: Simulates an election under various electoral systems, 
 *          including national popular vote (NPV), first-past-the-post (FPTP),
 *          proportional representation (PR), mixed-member representation (MMP),
 *          and weighted first-past-the-post (W-FPTP). Contains all of the ridings 
 *          in the election, as well as getter and setter methods which allow the user
 *          to get all ridings, get a riding with a specific ID, add a Riding,
 *          and add a Candidate to a riding. Additionally, provides methods to get 
 *          seat distributions under each electoral system.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
