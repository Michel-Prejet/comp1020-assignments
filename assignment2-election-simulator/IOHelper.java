 * INSTRUCTOR Simon Wermie
 * ASSIGNMENT 2, 6
 * 
 * @author Michel Pr√©jet
 * @version July 24th, 2025
 * 
 *          PURPOSE: Serves as a tool to populate an ElectionSimulator with 
 *          ridings and candidates created based on information read from given 
 *          CSV files, then write the output of an election under several systems
 *          to an output file. Provides methods to load candidates and ridings
 *          from CSV files, get the highest and lowest turnout ridings in the
 *          election, and get a list of candidates who reside outside of their
 *          riding. Also includes private helper methods to validate and parse
 *          input, print seat distributions, print the top two parties under any
 *          given system, and verify whether a province or a riding exists.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
