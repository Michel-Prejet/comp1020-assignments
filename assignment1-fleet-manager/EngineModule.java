 *          PURPOSE: Represents an engine module of a starship. Contains thrust 
 *          and fuel level variables, and simulates behaviours such as suffering 
 *          damage, undergoing maintenance, and undertaking expeditions. 
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
