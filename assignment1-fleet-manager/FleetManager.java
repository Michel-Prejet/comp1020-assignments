 * 
 *          PURPOSE: Represents a Fleet Manager, including the fleet's starships
 *          and expeditions, and their maximum amounts. Simulates behaviours such
 *          as adding a starship to the fleet, sending a specific starship on
 *          an expedition, adding a copy of a starship to the fleet, searching
 *          the fleet for a specific starship, and listing all starships or
 *          expeditions in the fleet.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
