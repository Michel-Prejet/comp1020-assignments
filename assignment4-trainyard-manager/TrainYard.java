 * @version August 8th, 2025
 * 
 *          PURPOSE: Represents a central train yard manager containing a list of 
 *          trains, people, and luggage. Provides methods to create trains, persons, 
 *          and luggage, and to retrieve them by name. Also provides methods to add 
 *          and remove passengers from the train, to locate the train car in which
 *          a specific person or luggage is travelling, to get an array containing 
 *          the names of all trains in the yard, and to get the maximum distance 
 *          a train can travel. Also includes various shunting methods, allowing
 *          the user to sort a train by car type, and to detach all of or parts of
 *          a train and append them onto another.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
