 *          PURPOSE: Represents a LuggageCar in a train, including its storage
 *          compartments and the next train car. Provides a getter method for
 *          latter, as well as methods to get the type of the current car, get
 *          its maximum luggage capacity, set the next train car, get the total
 *          weight of the luggage car, initialize a compartment, add luggage to
 *          a compartment, remove luggage from a compartment, and locate luggage
 *          by label.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
