 *          PURPOSE: Represents a FuelCar on a train, including its current fuel
 *          level, its maximum fuel level, and the next train car. Provides
 *          getter methods for the maximum fuel level and the next car, as well
 *          as methods to get the current car's type, set the next car, add
 *          fuel, and consume fuel.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
