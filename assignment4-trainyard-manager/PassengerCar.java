 *          PURPOSE: Represents a PassengerCar in a train, including its seats
 *          and the next train car. Provides a getter method for the latter, as
 *          well as methods to get the type of the current car, get the maximum
 *          capacity, set the next car, add a passenger, remove a passenger, and
 *          locate a passenger.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
