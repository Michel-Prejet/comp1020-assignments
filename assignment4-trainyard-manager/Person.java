 *          Provides getter methods for each of these instance variables, as
 *          well as methods to board the person on a train, check whether or not
 *          they have boarded a train, and add luggage.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
