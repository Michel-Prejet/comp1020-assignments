 * 
 *          PURPOSE: Represents a Train in a trainyard, including its name and
 *          all of its train cars (fuel cars, passenger cars, and luggage cars).
 *          Provides a getter method for the name, as well as methods to add
 *          a train car, remove a train car, attach a sequence of train cars,
 *          detach a sequence of train cars (by index or by train car), find
 *          the first car of a specific type, sort the train cars by type,
 *          add a passenger, deboard a passenger, find the passenger car of
 *          a passenger with a given name, find the luggage car of a luggage
 *          with a given label, get the size of the train, and calculate the
 *          maximum distance the train can travel.
 * 
 *          NOTE: the skeleton of this class was provided as a template by
 *          instructor Simon Wermie. Implementation logic was written by me.
