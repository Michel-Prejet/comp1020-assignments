# COMP 1020 Assignment 3: Navigation System

This project was built as an assignment for COMP 1020: Introductory Computer Science 2 at the University of Manitoba. The assignment emphasizes recursion, sorting algorithms, ArrayList, and OOP (object-oriented programming) as well as file I/O, exception handling, and string manipulation in Java. This includes insertion sort and selection sort implementations, recursive DFS (depth-first search) solutions, and instantiating objects using data read from CSV files. The assignment also involves writing a simple CLI interface for the program as a bonus step.
The program itself is CLI-based and simulates a starship navigation and routing system across a connected network of star systems. The main function of the program is to find all possible routes between two given star systems using a given starship, and to allow the user to analyze a specific route by providing information such as distance, cost, and safety.

---

## Context

The simulation consists of a network of star systems that:

- Belong to a faction,
- Are connected to other systems via hyperspace lanes,
- Have a specific danger level.

Starships are the vehicles used to travel between star systems. They have the following properties:

- Belong to a faction,
- Have a list of enemy factions,
- Consume antimatter units (AMUs),
- Consume a given amount of AMUs per light year,
- Have a specific cost in credits per antimatter unit (cr/AMU).

Note that hyperspace lanes are undirected - they can be travelled both ways in a route.

---

## General Overview

As a user, you can:

- Load starships, hyperspace lanes, and star systems from CSV files.
- Get a list of all starships and their properties.
- Get a list of all star systems (sorted alphabetically by name) and their properties.
- Get a list of all hyperspace lanes (sorted alphabetically by the name of their system of origin) and their properties.
- View and analyze all routes between two given star systems using a given starship.
  -  Get the route with the shortest/longest distance, the lowest cost, or the highest danger level. 
  -  Get a list of all toll-free routes or all safe routes.

## Technologies

- Built with Java (JDK 23).
- No external libraries.

---

## How To Run

Navigate to the project directory in the command line, then type the following:

```bash
javac *.java
java NavigationApp
```

---

## File Structure

The program consists of 6 files:
- `NavigationApp.java` - the main interface for the program.
- `Navigation.java` - provides core functionality. Loads starships, hyperspace lanes, and star systems from CSV files, and allows the user to find and analyze all valid routes between systems. 
- `Starship.java` - starship implementation.
- `StarSystem.java` - star system implementation.
- `HyperspaceLane.java` - hyperspace lane implementation.
- `Route.java` - route implementation.

---

## CSV Formatting

Place three CSV files in the project directory with any valid name and a header row. There should be one file containing starship information, one containing hyperspace lane information, and another containing star system information. For example:

`starships.csv`
Name,Faction,AntimatterPerLY,CostPerAntimatterUnit,EnemyFactions
Endeavour,Earth,3.5,5.7,Empire|Rebels
Raider,Empire,2.8,10.6,Earth|Neutral

`hyperspacelanes.csv`
FromSystem,ToSystem,Distance,TollCost
Sol,AlphaCentauri,5.0,1.0
AlphaCentauri,Draconis,7.0,2.0
Sol,Draconis,15.0,0.0

`starsystems.csv`
Name,Faction,DangerLevel
Sol,Earth,2
AlphaCentauri,Neutral,4

## Important Note

The instructor for the course, Simon Wermie, provided templates for each class except for `NavigationApp.java`. I do not take credit for the class skeletons of all files other than `NavigationApp.java`; however, all implementation logic and the entirety of `NavigationApp.java` is my own work.
